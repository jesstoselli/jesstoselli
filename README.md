# 👗 From tissues to the tags. 💻

Hello, devs!  👋

😇 My name is Jessyca and I'm a mobile developer, working with Android for over 3 years, and currently studying iOS/Swift. I also have some knowledge of hybrid platforms like React Native and Flutter.

I've transitioned careers in 2020, having previously worked as a Fashion Designer, and I have dived heads on into this amazing world of coding.

🚀 I've completed Udacity's [Android Kotlin Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-kotlin-developer-nanodegree--nd940) and recently graduated the Analysis and Systems Development course at Anhanguera Educacional.

🧶 _ My main developing languages are **Kotlin**/**Java**. I've worked for over three years with **Kotlin** in an proper production environment along with its companions such as Java, MVVM, Koin, Hilt, Retrofit 2 and others. I also quite enjoyed writting unit and instrumented tests with JUnit, Espresso, and Mockito. Now I've taken on a new challenge, refactoring a legacy Java Android app into a brand new Kotlin one.

🌍 _ I speak Portuguese, as I'm Brazilian, fluent English and Spanish, and also have a very good grasp of French and Italian.

#### 🚀 Come find me! I'm on LinkedIn as [Jessyca Toselli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessyca-toselli/)
