# 👗 From tissues to tags. 💻

Hello, devs!  👋

😇 My name is Jessyca and I'm a junior dev looking for a first-job opportunity.

I've transitioned careers earlier this year, having previously worked as a Fashion Designer, and I have dived heads on into this amazing world of coding.

🚀 I'm currently taking the Kotlin path in the 4th WomenCanCode edition, promoted by ShareRH. It's been an awesome ride and an incredibly rewarding one meeting so many talented women that may help reshape the future of IT into a more inclusive one.

🧶 _ I've a very good grasp of **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**

🧾 _ I'm currently learning **ReactJS**, **React Native** and **NodeJS**

🌍 I speak Portuguese, as I'm Brazilian, fluent English and Spanish and also have a very good grasp of French and Italian.
