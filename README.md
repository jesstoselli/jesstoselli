# 👗 From tissues to tags. 💻

Hello, devs!  👋

😇 My name is Jessyca and I'm a junior dev looking for a first-job opportunity.
I've transitioned careers earlier this year, having previously worked as a Fashion Designer , and have dived heads on into this amazing world of coding.
I'm currently taking @Rockeseat 's GoStack bootcamp and it's been an awesome and very challenging ride.

🧶 _ I've a very good grasp of **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**
🧾 _ I'm currently learning **ReactJS**, **React Native** and **NodeJS**

🌍 I speak Portuguese, as I'm Brazilian, fluent English and Spanish and also have a very good grasp of French and Italian.
