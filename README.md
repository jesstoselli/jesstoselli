# 👗 From tissues to the  tags. 💻

Hello, devs!  👋

😇 My name is Jessyca and I'm an Android junior developer at BEES (AB Inbev).

I've transitioned careers last year, having previously worked as a Fashion Designer, and I have dived heads on into this amazing world of coding.

🚀 Currently taking Udacity's [Android Kotlin Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-kotlin-developer-nanodegree--nd940) and also an Analysis and Systems Development graduation course at Anhanguera Educacional.

🧶 _ My main developing languages are **Kotlin** and **JavaScript**/**TypeScript**.

🧾 _ I'm currently learning to work with **Kotlin** in an proper production environment along with its companions such as Java, MVVM, Koin, Dagger, Retrofit 2 and others.

🌍 I speak Portuguese, as I'm Brazilian, fluent English and Spanish and also have a very good grasp of French and Italian.
