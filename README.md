# 👗 From tissues to the  tags. 💻

Hello, devs!  👋

😇 My name is Jessyca and I'm an Android developer.

I've transitioned careers in 2020, having previously worked as a Fashion Designer, and I have dived heads on into this amazing world of coding.

🚀 I've completed Udacity's [Android Kotlin Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-kotlin-developer-nanodegree--nd940) and I'm currently undertaking an Analysis and Systems Development graduation course at Anhanguera Educacional.

🧶 _ My main developing languages are **Kotlin** and **JavaScript**/**TypeScript**. I've worked two years with **Kotlin** in an proper production environment along with its companions such as Java, MVVM, Koin, Dagger, Retrofit 2 and others. I also quite enjoyed writting unit and instrumented tests with JUnit, Espresso, and Mockito.

🌍 _ I speak Portuguese, as I'm Brazilian, fluent English and Spanish, and also have a very good grasp of French and Italian.
