Hello, devs!  👋

😇 My name is Jessyca and I'm a mobile developer working with Android for over 4 years, and currently entering the world of iOS/Swift through Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP). I also have some knowledge of hybrid platforms like React Native and Flutter.

I've transitioned careers in 2020, having previously worked as a Fashion Designer, and I have dived heads on into this amazing world of coding.

🚀 I've completed Udacity's [Android Kotlin Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-kotlin-developer-nanodegree--nd940) and graduated the Analysis and Systems Development course at Anhanguera Educacional.

🧶 _ My main developing languages are **Kotlin**/**Java** and **Swift**. I've worked for over four years with **Kotlin** in a proper Android production environment along with its companions such as Java, MVVM, Koin, Hilt, Retrofit 2 and others. More recently, for the past two years I've been working with Android Jetpack Compose/KMP, and their companions (Ktor, KodeIn).

🌍 _ I speak Portuguese, as I'm Brazilian, fluent English and Spanish, and also have a very good grasp of French and Italian.

#### 🚀 Come find me! I'm on LinkedIn as [Jessyca Toselli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessyca-toselli/)
